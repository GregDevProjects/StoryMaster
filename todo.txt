As a user, I want the game to continue if I don't vote/write before the time limit ends 
    - after timer ends, vote for a random user or submit cute message

As a user, I don't want the game to restart when a new person joins 
    - new person can't participate until the current round is over
    - if room users < writings/votes && that user is not in a "waiting to start" state

As a user, I want the game to end with a winner 

As a user, I don't want to see the scores of people that leave 

As a user, I want the room to keep track of the game winner 

Determine conditions for when current story in room gets wiped

Make a bot that can play the game

Security stuff 
    - only accept requests from approved sites 
    - can't play if on the same ip
