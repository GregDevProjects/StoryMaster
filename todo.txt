Make sure user doesn't submit name twice

As a user, I want the game to continue if I don't vote/write before the time limit ends 
    - after timer ends, vote for a random user or submit cute message

All tests are failing right now because user must enter a name ot join a room :( 

As a user, I want the game to end with a winner 

As a user, I want some random text for my writing if I don't submit in time 

As a user, I don't want to see the scores of people that leave 

As a user, I want the room to keep track of the game winner 

As a user, I don't want the game to restart when a new person joins 
    - new person can't participate until the current round is over 



Make a bot that can play the game

Security stuff 
    - only accept requests from approved sites 
    - can't play if on the same ip
