As a user, I want the game to end with a winner 
- game goes for a predetermined amount of rounds 
- game doesn't restart if someone joins a game in progress 
- game shows the current story to someone who joins a game in progress 

As a user, I don't want to see the scores of people that leave 

As a user, I want the room to keep track of the game winner 

Determine conditions for when current story in room gets wiped

Make a bot that can play the game

Security stuff 
    - only accept requests from approved sites 
    - can't play if on the same ip 

Tests
    - counts votes correctly 
    - when timer runs out
        - placeholder writing 
        - random votes 
    - joining a game in progress 
        - continues round 
        - restarts round
