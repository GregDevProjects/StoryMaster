As a user, I want to be able to learn how to play the game
    -help button is on the bottom right of every page 
    -opens modal on click?

Code stuff
    - boot users to the loading page if enough users leave mid game
    - should this be handled on each page or on index.js?

Security stuff 
    - only accept requests from approved sites 
    - can't play if on the same ip 
    - captcha

Forced resolution (if required)

Tests

        - placeholder writing 
        - random votes 
    - joining a game in progress 
        - continues round 
        - restarts round
